## Ethereal

This is a sleek, futuristic Web3 project with [Next JS](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://react.dev), 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Setup Instructions

There is no special setup, just make sure all environments are up to standard (for example the Node JS version).
The rest is the same as usual.

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

wait until it's finished, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

For Lighthouse reports, it's in the root directory with the name lighthouse-report.html

## Design Decisions

Clean and neat design with ample whitespace and lines as clear boundaries. Gives a minimalist impression.
Thanks to [godly.website](https://godly.website) and [minimal.gallery](https://minimal.gallery) for some inspiration.

## Challenges Faced

Web3 is new to me. I researched related topics such as Blockchain, NFT, Ethereum and DeFi to understand Web3 more deeply.
For wallet connection, i use [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com).
Thanks to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) for some suggestions of slogans and paragraphs regarding Web3 content.
